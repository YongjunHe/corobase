\seclabel{design:prototype}

We implement a prototype of the RIA architecture and measure its performance.  For the implementation of the prototype we use a large fraction of the publicly available Silo codebase~\footnote{Silo's codebase can be downloaded from: https://github.com/stephentu/silo.} Silo uses the Masstree \cite{MaoKM12} as a cache-efficient index structure.
