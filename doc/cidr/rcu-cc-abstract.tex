\begin{abstract}

Modern systems with large main memories and massively parallel processors have inspired many new high-performance OLTP systems, often referred to as ``main memory DBMS'' (MMDBMS). 
We examine existing systems and show how their choice of CC is largely dictated by their system architecture---for better or for worse---and that it can be difficult or impossible to adopt a different CC scheme without significant changes to the rest of the system. 
We report on some early progress in designing a MMDBMS from the ground up to support efficient concurrency control, and how the resulting architecture does not necessarily sacrifice performance in other areas.
