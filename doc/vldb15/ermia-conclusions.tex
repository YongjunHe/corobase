\section{Conclusion}
\seclabel{conclusion}

In this paper we underlined the weaknesses of recent OCC-based transaction processing system proposals, and presented a novel system that does not rely on partitioning, provides robust concurrency control even for mixed workloads, addresses the physical interactions between threads in a scalable way and has a clear recovery methodology.
We believe that this is a significant step toward efficiently processing mixed transactional workloads.
