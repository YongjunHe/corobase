\section{Conclusion}
\seclabel{conclusion}

In this paper we underlined the weaknesses of recent OCC-based transaction processing system proposals, and presented a novel system with more robust performance due to its concurrency control.
The point we want to make is that concurrency control is a fundamental component of any transaction processing system, and that it cannot be baked in after the fact to system. Instead, transaction processing system designers should think of concurrency control from the beginning as the decision about the concurrency control mechanism will dictate most of the design decision of all the other components of the systems.
